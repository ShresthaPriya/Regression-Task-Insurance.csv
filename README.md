# Regression-Task-Insurance.csv

For the regression, I have used insurance.csv dataset from kaggle. The dataset contains 1338 rows and 7 columns. The columns are:

Age :- This is an integer indicating the age of the primary beneficiary (excluding those above 64 years, since they are generally covered by the government).

Sex :- This is the policy holder's gender, either male or female.

BMI :- This is the body mass index (BMI), which provides a sense of how over or under-weight a person is relative to their height. BMI is equal to weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. An ideal BMI is within the range of 18.5 to 24.9.

Children :- This is an integer indicating the number of children / dependents covered by the insurance plan.

Smoker :- This is yes or no depending on whether the insured regularly smokes tobacco.

Region :- This is the beneficiary's place of residence in the U.S., divided into four geographic regions - northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest.

Chargesâ€‹ :- Individual medical costs billed to health insurance This dataset information was taken from the kaggle. Here, charges are the dependent variable, I am analysing based on the dependent variables.
